After about a week of testing, Godot 4.1.3 is ready for production use. As Godot 4.2 [is being finalized](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-2-beta-4) we stay committed to providing support for users remaining on the current stable version of the engine. Our architecture and approach to release management allow us to easily pick many bugfixes and smaller improvements from the upcoming release and apply them to previous releases without compromising their stability.

The third maintenance release for Godot 4.1 contains a number of fixes for the rendering system, addressing issues across all rendering backends, in lightmap and voxel global illumination systems, and in GPU particles. Various problems were resolved in the editor UI, and in the engine's GUI system in general. The Input team improved controller support and solved a couple of issues specific to the Android platform. An important fix was also added to improve support for Android 14, as well as fixes for various bugs on other target platforms.

Finally, several documentation mistakes have been corrected, plus there is new documentation available for the `RenderingDevice` class.
