Since we had a great & productive time last year, and 2,000 pins dispersed around the world to prove it, we are attending the [Game Developer Conference](https://gdconf.com/) (GDC) again. It is taking place March 18-22 in San Francisco, California.

This year, [W4 Games](https://w4games.com/) is organizing a Godot Pavilion and the Godot Foundation will be there hosting a selection of developers who could not be more stoked to let you play their Godot Engine games on the expo floor.

**You will find us at: booth S763, North & South Halls, Moscone Center.**

To visit the conference you must purchase a visitor pass. Access to the show floor is available starting with the Expo Pass. Check the [GDC website](https://gdconf.com/passes-prices) for more information.
